This project builds out from the echo gist for flux provided
by Mark Grondona.  If you're not running flux on LLNL's 
quartz cluster, this will probably be of limited use.

Intended order of operations:

./salloc.sh
./flux.sh
./load_var.sh
./test_var.sh
./unload_var.sh

See the comments at the end of echo.c for more information,
including the location of the gist.
