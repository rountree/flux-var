List of things to do for small-scale demo on Thursday July 2nd.

1. Barry: Write dlopen code for Variorum (will already be linked to Jannson library).
2. Tapasya: Verify jannson is still linked into variorum.
3. Tapasya: Implement JSON interface for IBM. (1 day) 
4. Tapasya: Identify, compile and test CPU and GPU workload for Lassen (Pennant?)
6. Barry:  Write code to transfer JSON data into KVS.
7. Barry:  Write the min/mean/max/current power and energy code?

Need soon but not this week:
1. Barry:  Write code in Flux to query variorum about number of CPUs and accelerators.
2. Stephanie:  Write code to determine number of CPUs and accelerators.
3. Stephanie: Code in variorum that describes what the knobs are.  
4. Stephanie:  Should we compile an IBM-specific version of Var or does Var figure
	out which arch-dependent code to dlopen?
5. All:  Determine how to make the JSON interface vendor-neutral.

Need mid-term:
1. PlatformIO interface
2. PowerAPI interface
3. Intel + nVidia knobs
